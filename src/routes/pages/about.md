## Hi, I'm Jake!

I'm 20 years old, lgbt+, and 80+ dragons in a trenchcoat.

**I'm not particularly well versed in social media** and I tend to abandon most of my socials at times. The only social media I'm consistently active on is discord, and I don't tend to give my discord out to strangers. Even self hosted social media like mastodon is difficult for me, unless it's a very small group for only a couple of people.

**Some of my interests are**
- webdev, software in general
- gamedev
- digital art
- yelling about twitter politics from a distance
- a lot of STEM fields, yell at me about macrobiology or space for example
