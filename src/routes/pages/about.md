## Hi, I'm Jake!

I'm currently a student in software development. I'm based in Europe (the Netherlands) and I'm 19 years old.

 Most of my experience is in frontend webdev right now, but I'm aiming to learn more about backend and non-webdev as well!

### Stuff I like working on:
- web development
- minecraft mods (total rookie at this still)
- discord bots (...rarely)
- digital art
- anything else that piques my interest
***
### Things that I can do
I currently am decent at javascript/typescript, some frontend frameworks (react, svelte) and I have some experience in C#.

### Things that I'm learning atm!
Currently getting my hands dirty with java, rust and php. I'd like to know a lot of languages eventually!

### Projects I've worked on

- more stuff coming... at one point
