## Development, Code, and Tech

I'm currently a student in software development.

Most of my experience is in frontend webdev, but I do have some skill with backend dev as well.

### Stuff I like working on
- web development
- minecraft mods
- discord bots (...rarely)
- anything else that piques my interest
***
### Things that I can do
I currently am most experienced in javascript and especially typescript, some frontend frameworks ([react](https://reactjs.org/), [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)). I also know my way around C# and java.

I know HTML and CSS pretty well and am able to create modern, responsive designs without any CSS frameworks involved.

I've mostly used nodejs up until this point, but I also am getting started with [deno](https://deno.land/).

### Things that I'm learning
Currently getting my hands dirty with [go](https://go.dev/)!

### Projects I've worked on
- [PluralKit's dashboard](https://dash.pluralkit.me)
- [Profilebuilder](https://profilebuilder.fulmine.xyz) (still a work in progress)
- more stuff coming... soon™️.
