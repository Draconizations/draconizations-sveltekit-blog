## Development, Code, and Tech

I'm currently a student in software development.

Most of my experience is in frontend webdev right now, but I'm aiming to learn more about backend and non-webdev as well!

### Stuff I like working on:
- web development
- minecraft mods (total rookie at this still)
- discord bots (...rarely)
- anything else that piques my interest
***
### Things that I can do
I currently am decent at javascript/typescript, some frontend frameworks (react, svelte) and I have some experience in C#.

### Things that I'm learning atm!
Currently getting my hands dirty with java, rust, go and php.

- more stuff coming... soon™️.
