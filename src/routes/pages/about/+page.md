I'm 20 years old, lgbt+, and 90+ dragons in a trenchcoat.

**I'm not particularly well versed in social media**, I only tend to be active on discord and the fediverse.

**Some of my interests are**
- webdev, [software in general](/pages/tech)
- gamedev
- digital art
- yelling about twitter politics from a distance
- a lot of STEM fields, yell at me about macrobiology or space for example
