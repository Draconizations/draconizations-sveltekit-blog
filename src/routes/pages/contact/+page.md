## Contact Me!

The best way to reach me at the moment is [through email](mailto:jake@fulmine.xyz). I am pretty active on discord too, but I'd like to keep that to casual conversation.

[Github](https://github.com/draconizations) is where most of my public projects are hosted at the moment, including this site!

My [twitter](https://twitter.com/fxlmine) is not that active, so don't try to reach me on there.
