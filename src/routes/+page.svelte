    <p>My name is Jake, or Rads, or Pals. I'm a 20 year old nerd who enjoys a wide variety of things, but is going into software as a career (hopefully).</p>

        <p>The main project I work on right now is <a href="https://dash.pluralkit.me">the dashboard for the discord bot PluralKit</a>.
        I have a couple of side-projects as well, but who knows if they'll ever see the light of day.</p>
        <p>This is just my personal space where I can post whatever I please. Don't expect this to be all development talk.</p>
