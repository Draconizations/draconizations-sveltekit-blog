It's been a while since I last made a post on here. The reason why? I didn't really feel the need to. But now that it's been exactly 4 months, I think a (short) update is due.

### Bring on the updates
- A lot of the content on this website got an overhaul. I've updated my contact page, my about me, my age, my development skills page. Basically everything that involves words.

- I'm more active on the fediverse than I am on twitter right now, which isn't surprising considering the Great Muskrat Takeover of 2022. I never really was too active on twitter to begin with, but fedi's atmosphere is nicer in general. Find me over at [@fulmine@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@fulmine)!

- In the past few months I've been picking up running my own servers. Still in the cloud (for now), but it's been nice setting up my own projects on an actual server through ssh. In the past I've only deployed static sites. Unfortunately, I don't really have anything here that I can show off, but there might be something in the future.

- I've been very slowly chipping away at a project called [profilebuilder](https://profilebuilder.fulmine.xyz). Which lets you create fake discord profiles for yourself. It's a heavy work in progress and there's only a small amount of features as of now, but you'll be able to create a full profile with an about me and spotify song in the future âœ¨

That's it for now, I have important businesses to attend to (which means that I'm writing this in the middle of class and I should get back to my schoolwork). Goodbye everyone and have a nice one.
