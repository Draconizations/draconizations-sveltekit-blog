Now writing blog posts should be easy, I hope.</p>\n<p>Just to give you all a taste of my struggles, as well as some tips to get sveltekit working with the <code>gh-pages</code> npm module, I’ll lay out some details below:</p>\n<ul><li>don’t forget the .nojekyll file. It breaks a lot of stuff</li>\n<li>don’t try to change the build directory to <code>./build</code>, even though that is the default, it breaks even more stuff somehow (aka leaves the build directory empty other than the favicon).</li>\n<li>don’t forget the CNAME file as well, unless you want to manually edit that in every time you publish your website.</li>\n<li>and finally, CHECK what you’re publishing before you publish it, I had to delete the <code>gh-pages</code> branch because I pushed my file system paths, including my deadname, on there multiple times!</li></ul>\n<p>But, oh well, I managed to get here. Future blog posts on the way!</p>","css":{"code":"","map":null},"head":""},"meta":{"title":"IT LIVES!","path":"2022-07-08-it-lives","date":"2022-07-08","tags":["meta"]}}]
